Saying "do not ask about my past," she walks away from them and wanders into a Buddhist temple. One of the images of the Buddha dissolves into the face of a young man, and then a flashback begins that will tell Oharu's life from near the beginning.</p><p>Her life is the fate in microcosm of many Japanese women for centuries, in a society ruled by a male hierarchy. <a href=#>Kenji Mizoguchi</a>, its director, was as sympathetic with women as any of his contemporaries, even Ozu, who whom he is often ranked. He made prostitutes a frequent subject, as in his "Street of Shame" (1956). He was known to frequent brothels, not simply to purchase favors, but to socialize with their workers; it made a great impression on him that his own sister, Suzo, who raised him, was sold by their father as a geisha. The same thing happens to Oharu in this film.</p><p>The character is played by <a href=#>Kinuyo Tanaka</a>, who appeared in 14 of his films, and this one, made in 1952, helped redirect her career from early years as in ing√©nue toward more challenging roles. One of her strengths as Oharu is her success at playing the same character over a period of 30 years.</p><p>As Oharu's flashback begins, we learn she was born in respectable circles, and was a lady in waiting at the court when she and a young page (<a href=#>Toshiro Mifune</a>) fell in love. This was forbidden, the page was condemned to death, and Oharu and his family were exiled. Her father never forgives her for this, and indeed after the scandal she becomes unmarriagable in respectable circles. There is a brief respite when he is able to sell her as a concubine into the household of Lord Matsudaira. Her duty there is to bear him an heir, which she does, but then is coldly sent back into poverty and prostitution. Her father, who now considers her entirely in terms of her wage-earning ability, sells her as a courtesan, at which she balks, and finally sells her into service as a maid to a lady who uses elaborate wigs to conceal from her husband that she is half-bald. She loses this job because one of her employer's customers recognizes her from the shimabara (red-light district) and makes crude jokes which reveal her background.</p><p>Now comes a deceptive respite from her misery. She meets a nice man, a maker of fans, and settles in peacefully, but he is killed. She receives no legacy. In a convent, she tells the superior she wanted none: "All I want is to be a nun and be near to Buddha." In the convent, there is an ambiguous scene. A man who knew her comes to demand repayment for a gift of cloth she was given, and in a fury she strips off her clothing and hurls it at him. Her nudity is reflected only in the man's eye, but the discovery of this event leads to her banishment from the convent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gqZ6ZpGK6sMLInmStoJViuaqyxGamn2Wfna6zwYxqcG5q</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brad-nagel-missing-a-red-wing-man-who-disappeared-near-diamond-bluff-hager-city.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Nagel Missing: A Red Wing Man Who Disappeared Near Diamond Bluff, Hager City">&larr;
