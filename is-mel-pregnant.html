She's pregnant, and he might not be the father. Yes, the news is shocking, but it isn't a total surprise.<h2>Does Mel Monroe get pregnant?</h2>In season three, Mel revealed she was pregnant again but given the timing, she wasn't sure if the baby was Jack's or her late husband Mark's. Either way, fans are predicting there will be another health scare for Mel in season four.<h2>Is Jack the father of Mels baby?</h2>As Virgin River fans know, amid her breakup with Jack, Mel went through a round of IVF using an embryo she'd previously created with her late husband. Since the timelines of conception overlap, the paternity of her baby is unclear.<h2>Does Mel get pregnant in Virgin River?</h2>Fans have offered a simple solution to Mel's quandary at the end of Virgin River season four. At the start of the finale, A Wedding, No Funeral and a Baby, Mel realises her IVF treatment has been successful and she's now pregnant.<h2>"I Don't Know If You're The Father" - Virgin River Season 3 Final Scene | Netflix</h2><p></p><h2>Is Jack Charmaine's baby daddy?</h2>“As many here around wondered about, I think this is just the confirmation that Jack is not the father and Charmaine will be out of his life,” they said. As fans of the Virgin River book series know, Charmaine wasn't even a main character, and it turned out that she was pregnant by an acquaintance of Jack.<h2>Are Charmaine's twins jacks babies?</h2>Charmaine has told Jack that he is the twins' father. However, she and her new lawyer husband, Todd (Patrick Sabongui) are doing everything in their power to limit Jack's parental rights which seems highly suspicious.<h2>Does Mel get pregnant in Charmed?</h2>In the finale of season 3, Mel gave her unborn baby back to Future Mel, transferring the pregnancy between the two of them. Technically, by stopping the Whispering Evil, the Charmed Ones erased Future Mel's apocalyptic future from existence. Though, that doesn't mean Mel would never get pregnant in a different future.<h2>What episode does Mel get pregnant Charmed?</h2>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Charmed Season 3, Episode 16, "What to Expect When You're Expecting the Apocalypse," which aired Friday on The CW. Charmed's latest episode showed Mel still adapting to her surprise pregnancy.<h2>How could Mel be pregnant with marks baby?</h2>During a visit to Los Angeles, she went through a round of IVF with an embryo she'd created with her late husband Mark (Daniel Gillies). Since she had also been intimate with Jack before their breakup, the paternity of her baby is in question. Still, Breckenridge says she understands Mel's choices.<h2>Is Jack the father of Charmaine's twins in the books?</h2>Charmaine is currently pregnant with Jack's twins. This has split from the books in a couple of major ways.<h2>Who is the father of Mel baby in Virgin River?</h2>According to the story line, Mel and Jack had broken up for some time in Season 3. While Jack was reluctant to have another baby at first, he comes around after Mel finally becomes pregnant. However, the biological father of the baby she is carrying could quite possibly be Mark since the two froze his embryos.<h2>Does Mel get pregnant in Melissa and Joey?</h2>They finally tie the knot in the season 3 finale At Last while Mel is on pain killers in the hospital (she fell off the roof). After months of trying to have a baby, Mel finally gets pregnant in 2015; it is subsequently revealed that she is pregnant with twins.<h2>Do Mel and Jack get married in season 4?</h2>Sue Tenney also confirmed that Jack and Mel in Virgin River Season 4 are going to be married. “Eventually, they are going to get married,” She said. Referring to Mel's baby in the show, actor Martin Henderson went on explaining, “At the drop of a hat, she goes and [uses the embryos she had with] her dead ex-husband.<h2>Is Mal pregnant in Charmed?</h2>Melonie Diaz announced she was pregnant in March 2021.<p>The couple had been engaged since July 2019, but decided to elope mid-pandemic. This will be their first child together. Melonie's pregnancy announcement was super sweet, in case you were wondering.</p><h2>Who is replacing Macy on Charmed?</h2>Who is Lucy Barrett? Meet the new witch replacing Macy in 'Charmed' Season 4. A new Charmed One for The CW's Charmed reboot has been found. Australian Lucy Barrett has joined Melonie Diaz (Mel) and Sarah Jeffery (Maggie) as leads in the upcoming fourth season of the CBS Studios series.<h2>Who does Mel end up with in Charmed?</h2>Mel was the girlfriend of detective Niko Hamada before she altered history to remove her from her life and is the ex-girlfriend of Jada Shields. She is currently dating Ruby. She is close friends with the Whitelighter of all of the Charmed Ones, Harry Greenwood.<h2>Does Charmaine get pregnant in the book Virgin River?</h2>Jack and fans were stunned when Jack's ex-girlfriend, Charmaine (Lauren Hammersley), revealed that she was pregnant with his twins. However, some Virgin River fans are no longer convinced that Jack is the father of the babies.<h2>Is Charmaine not pregnant with Jack's baby?</h2>In the first season of the show, we discover she's pregnant with Jack's child, while the second season reveals she's actually having twins.<h2>Do Jack and Charmaine get back together?</h2>They did just get back together. For Jack, “it's quite important that he shows her that his commitment is absolute, and what better way to do that than to take those vows and make it forever?” Henderson says.<h2>Does Mel and Jack have a baby in Virgin River Books?</h2>Virgin River enthusiasts will already know Mel and Jack have a son of their own named David in Robyn Carr's series of novels. Even so, showrunner Sue Tenney won't necessarily be sticking to the original story as the television adaptation progresses.<h2>Is Jack Doc and Hope's son?</h2>Though some Virgin River fans were puzzled up until then, this seemed to indicate the Jack isn't Hope's mom. It also should be noted that he never calls her mom. Jack and Hope's relationship has never been explored in-depth in the series, but it's clear that despite Hope's meddling the pair do have a strong bond.<h2>Do Mel and Jack end up together?</h2>The good news: Mel (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Jack (Martin Henderson) are back together after breaking up — she wanted kids, he wasn't so sure — by the end of Virgin River Season 3.<h2>Did Mel get IVF in Virgin River?</h2>Why did Mel decide to go through with IVF on 'Virgin River'? For many fans, Mel's decision to go through with IVF just a few days after her breakup with Jack seemed like a rash choice. However, Breckinridge says she understands her character's frame of mind entirely.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKadnGK9s7HGp5inrA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./street-fighter-ii-ousted-capcoms-alltime-seller-resident-evil-5.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Resident Evil 5 Replaces Street Fighter II As Capcoms New All-Time Best Seller">&larr;
