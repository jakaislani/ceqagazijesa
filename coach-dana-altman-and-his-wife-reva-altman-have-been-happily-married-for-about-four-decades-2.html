Dana has four children with Reva.</p><p>Reva Phillips is originally from Stanton, Nebraska.&nbsp;Altman is an American college basketball coach currently the head coach of the University of Oregon Ducks men’s basketball team.</p><p>He led Creighton, Kansas State, and Marshall as their head coach. In addition to leading his teams to fifteen appearances in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, Altman has won conference coach of the year titles at each school where he has served as head coach.</p><h2 id=dana-altman-wife-reva-altman-is-a-nebraska-native><span class=ez-toc-section id=dana-altman-wife-reva-altman-is-a-nebraska-native></span> Dana Altman Wife Reva Altman Is A Nebraska Native<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dana Altman and his wife, Reva Altman, now call Oregon their home after initially coming from Nebraska. However, she had difficulty adapting to a new place.</p><p>Dana has achieved many things throughout his career, but his long-term relationship with his wife must be his most significant milestone. The couple dated for over seven years before tieing the knot.&nbsp;</p><p>The head coach once claimed that he likes to take time before doing anything when he said about his long dating history with his current wife. His habit of taking the time has a beneficial impact as, for instance, we can see he prepared some famous coaches like Tony Stubblefield, who worked under Dana.</p><p>Altman also jokingly said she could have done much better for a partner.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=reva-had-difficulty-shifting-places></span>Reva Had Difficulty Shifting Places<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Reva grew up in Stanton, Nebraska, and is doing pretty well for herself, raising a family and marrying a guy who had eighteen consecutive winning seasons in collegiate basketball. Reva, currently 61, is a mother of four, and expresses herself as a pro-life conservative.</p><p>The Altman couple’s first season in Oregon has been, to put it mildly, an adjustment being far from home and friends, but Dana approached it tactically by bringing his son Jordan along to be his video coordinator.</p><p>Reva claims that Dana was surrounded by several familiar faces, which helped. Moreover, she said her husband found it difficult because he left behind family, friends, and the school to that he dedicated 16 years of his life.</p><p>The marriage of the couple has had a lot of memorable moments not only for them but for the fans as well. For instance, they surprised Sports Director at KVAL news, Hayden Herera, with their broadcasting skills in 2019.</p><h2 id=dana-and-reva-altman-have-four-kids><span class=ez-toc-section id=dana-and-reva-altman-have-four-kids></span> Dana And Reva Altman Have Four Kids <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reva Altman shares four kids with her husband Dana in their long marriage. They have three sons and a daughter.</p><p>Jordon, the couple’s first son, is currently 38, while their second-born, Chase, is 36. Their third child, Spencer, is currently 34. Finally, the youngest child in the family and the first and only daughter, Audra, is presently 30.</p><p>Reva and her daughter Audra stayed in Omaha until Audra graduated from Millard West High School in December 2010. Dana and Reva initially resided in an apartment while they carried out a time-consuming search for a home.</p><p>She later became a student at Oregon and graduated. Following those initial months of adjustment, she claims that going to Oregon has also been simple. The university and its students were outstanding, and the experience was fantastic.</p><p>Jordon assisted his father as a video coordinator in his initial years in Oregon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuflrCpecOapZplkaHBrq3NZpinnF2dtrR51qKdnmWimsOiecClq6aZnmK1osLEZpmenZ5itaK8z6KjsmWdlr%2BztcSdZJ%2BnomKuo7vUrWSfp6WneqWxwpqbnqtdZ3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jolene-anderson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jolene Anderson  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
