Answer
What does it mean when the lights on my battery flash red, green, and white? Typically, this is caused by a connection issue. A small amount of debris can occasionally cause a connection issue, resulting in the pen reaching its maximum capability. In addition, it’s possible that some debris has gotten into the connection between the battery and the charger.
People have also inquired as to why their vape is flashing white.</description></item><item><title/><link>/viltrumites-from-invincible-are-essentially-saiyans-so-lets-pit-them-against-their-dbz-counterparts.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/viltrumites-from-invincible-are-essentially-saiyans-so-lets-pit-them-against-their-dbz-counterparts.html</guid><description>Amazon Prime is putting a new twist on the classic superhero formula.
