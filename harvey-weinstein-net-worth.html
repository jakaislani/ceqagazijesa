Harvey was sentenced to 23 years in March 2020.</p><p>Weinstein was reportedly too cash-poor at times after the scandals to pay for different spousal support responsibilities.</p><p>On January 12, 2017, Harvey told a judge that he was too broke to pay alimony and child support to his first wife and their two children.</p><img

ex-wife replied by alleging that he spent all of his cash assets on pre-paying millions of dollars in attorney’s fees to shield him from numerous prospective lawsuits around the world.</p><p>Some have chastised Weinstein for the tactics he reportedly used in his commercial dealings.</p><p>It included ‘campaigning’ for Oscars for his films during Oscar season, which led to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences banning such campaigns.</p><p>Weinstein was known for his brutality and outbursts of rage.</p><p>He allegedly once kicked a New York Observer reporter out of a party after putting him in a headlock.</p><h2>Harvey Weinstein | Quick Facts</h2><p>So, let’s get to know Harvey Weinstein a little better, starting with some basic facts about him.</p><table cellspacing=0
