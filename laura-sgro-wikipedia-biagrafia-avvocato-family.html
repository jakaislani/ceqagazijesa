The lawyer also has not mentioned her parent’s profession in the media.</p><p>According to the lawyer, her career is nothing to be astonished about, to which she further explains, “I’m now accustomed to traveling the globe, but I frequently return to Sicily.”</p><p>To be able to return, I even accept employment tasks there. The attorney Sgr. speaks infrequently, almost as if she doesn’t want to share her accomplishments directly.</p><p>The lawyer attended high school at Mamertine and received <a href=# rel=noopener>a law degree</a> from the University of Messina with a comparative criminal law thesis on sexual offenses against minors comparing Italian and English legislation.</p><p>She relocated to Rome, where she earned a Ph.D. and a license in canon law.
