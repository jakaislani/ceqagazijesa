There is no single listing of these courses – you will have to contact Ucas for help or call individual universities to ask if they offer these courses.<h2>Do all UK universities require A levels?</h2>University Entry Requirements. Each course in the UK sets it own entry, so they vary considerably. Most degree programs in the UK will require that the student have passed either A-levels and attained certain grades, for example 4 B grades, or equivalent grades in a BTEC or GNVQ.<h2>WHAT A levels do you need to go to university?</h2>GCSEs. Most universities will look for an 4/5 at GCSE (A*-C under the old grading system) in English, maths and possibly science. Specific courses may also ask for minimum grades in certain relevant GCSE subjects, while competitive courses will look for strong GCSE results as an indicator of your academic ability.<h2>Can you go to uni with just GCSEs?</h2>You could start with The Open University with just GCSEs, but this is distance learning so you would be learning at home (there are some tutorials but these are on average once a month).<h2>How to get accepted to Uni without A levels</h2><p></p><h2>Can I go to uni without GCSEs?</h2>Study hard and you can make up for a lack of GCSEs.
