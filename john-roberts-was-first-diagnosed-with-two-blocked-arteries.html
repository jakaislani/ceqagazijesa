I hadn’t been feeling good for quite some time.”</p><p>The former White House journalist said that he had a cardiac operation and was fitted with a pacemaker for his heart. He said that his earlier stent had become obstructed and needed to be reopened:</p><p>“It turned out that the stents I got during Trump’s trip to Helsinki with Putin were clogged up again. So they reopened it, but, like former Vice President Mike Pence, the electrical wiring in my heart was failing. As a result, I’m now battery-powered. “I have a pacemaker.”</p><p>The reporter said that he was feeling “75 percent” better and hoped to recover “100 percent” shortly. John Roberts also expressed gratitude to his physicians and care team for the diagnoses and treatment he received.</p><h2>A Look at John Roberts’ cardiac problems</h2><p>In 2018, John Roberts was diagnosed with two blocked arteries for the first time. Doctors at MedStar Washington Hospital addressed his illness at the time by inserting artificial tubes into his heart to boost blood flow.&nbsp;One of the stents, however, had just been obstructed and needed emergency medical treatment. The newest problem, according to Roberts, was identified when physicians did “a small ultrasound” within his coronary artery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/John-Roberts-2.jpg alt="John Roberts" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The television host also said that a routine angiogram would have missed the problem with the obstructed stent. Doctors implanted a pacemaker in Roberts’ heart after fixing the broken stent to monitor his cardiac status and manage his heart rhythm.&nbsp;During an interview with The Washingtonian in 2020, the reporter blamed his heart problems on years of smoking:</p><p>“I used to smoke, which is why I have three pieces of stainless steel in my heart.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A huge shout out to the team at <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@InovaHealth</a> Fairfax who identified and repaired a blocked stent, and put a pacemaker in a heart that had been ridden hard and put away wet one too many times. Dr. Haddad, Dr. Tehrani, Dr. Batchelor, Dr. Atwater and the whole care team. Thank you!</p><p>— John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 29, 2022</a></p><p>However, John Roberts said that he now values healthy food and leads a “healthy lifestyle.” In addition, the reporter said that he is a “sports fanatic” who likes “cycling, tennis, golf, walking, trekking, and skiing.”&nbsp;He apparently enjoys being in “pretty reasonable form” and feels that “”Staying healthy and fit” is important to him “on several levels.”</p><h2>Highlights from Roberts’ career</h2><p>John Roberts is a Canadian-American journalist who co-hosts Fox News’ America Reports.
