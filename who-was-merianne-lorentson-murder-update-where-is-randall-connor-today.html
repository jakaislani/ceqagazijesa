We hope her soul received relief to receive justice.</strong></p><p>Merianne Lorentson was killed in her apartment brutally by the killer, stabbed as many times as thirty times. Why does the killer express so much hatred against her?</p><p>It was indeed sad news as she was left a child 5 years old then behind. Losing a mother at an early age is sad some as that’s an important time for any kid to be with her mother.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who Was Merianne Lorentson?">Who Was Merianne Lorentson?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Merianne Lorentson Murder Update">Merianne Lorentson Murder Update</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Where Is Randall Connor Today?">Where Is Randall Connor Today?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-merianne-lorentson></span>Who Was Merianne Lorentson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorentson was the single mother of five years old kid when she was killed. She was an aspiring model and was 24 years of age when unfortunately she had to leave the world.</p><p>She might have never thought that March 9, 2007, would be the black day of her life. The model was found dead at an apartment in the 10400 block of Kent-Kangley Road.</p><p>The mother of five was stabbed in her head, neck, and body according to the King County Medical Examiner’s autopsy report. Merianne Lorentson was born on 5th September 1982.</p><p>Her parents were Jerry and the late Marlene Sloan Lorentson. Jerry Lorentson was a former King County prosecutor who died in 2009. The official involved said it could not be a random kill.</p><p>Luckily, Merianne’s daughter Jade was not present at the crime scene when she was attacked and killed. King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng called it a ‘terrible tragedy.’</p><p>Her brother said earlier, “She wanted she and my niece to be either models or on TV. She was well on her way to making that dream come true.” But her life had been taken.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=merianne-lorentson-murder-update></span>Merianne Lorentson Murder Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Connor lived in SeaTac had dated Lorentson. At the time of Lorentson’s murder, Connor was out of prison for about two months. He admitted that he possessed a gun and knives.</p><p>Kent detective carried out DNA test results, cell phone records, and interviews with friends and relatives of Connor and Lorentson to build their case against Connor.</p><p>Connor was arrested on March 12, 2007, in Seattle on a California parole violation. They were in a relationship since 2005. Connor told detective Lorentson never wanted to break up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-randall-connor-today></span>Where Is Randall Connor Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Randall Connor was convicted of first-degree murder for killing Marianne Lorentson in her East Hill apartment. Jury selection is expected to start at the end of February 2011.</p><p>It will be at King County Superior Court in Seattle for the man charged with stabbing to death a Kent woman thirty times back in 2007, fourteen years ago.</p><p>Conner was supposed to face a sentence range of 23 to 28 years in prison upon conviction. He would remain in custody at the county jail in Seattle in place of $2 million bails.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmpJ6qmZa7r7GMpaarnZ6pwLC6jKasq5yVp3q2vMOaq55lp52ys7GMoqpmqpGjsaK4y2aaqKaepL9uwM6dmLJn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carlos-oher-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carlos Oher- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend">&larr;
