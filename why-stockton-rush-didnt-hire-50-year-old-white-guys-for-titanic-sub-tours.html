The US Coast Guard said the small submarine began its journey underwater with five passengers Sunday morning, and the Canadian research vessel that it was working with lost contact with the crew about an hour and 45 minutes into the dive.</p><p>It was later found that a<a href=#> top-secret team with the US Navy</a> detected the implosion of the Titan submersible on Sunday, but did not stop search efforts due because the evidence was “not definitive” and a decision was made to “make every effort to save the lives on board.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was on board?</h2><p>The family of world explorer <a href=#>Hamish Harding confirmed on Facebook</a> that he was among the five traveling in the missing submarine.&nbsp;Harding, a British businessman who previously paid for a space ride aboard the Blue Origin rocket last year, shared a photo of himself on Sunday signing a banner for OceanGate’s latest voyage to the shipwreck.&nbsp;</p><p>Also onboard were Pakistani energy and tech mogul Shanzada Dawood and his son Sulaiman, 19; famed French diver and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and OceanGate founder and CEO Stockton Rush.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s next?</h2><p>“We’re doing everything we can do to locate the submersible and rescue those on board,” <a href=#>Rear Adm. John Mauger told reporters</a>. “In terms of the hours, we understood that was 96 hours of emergency capability from the operator.</p><p>Coast Guard officials said they are currently focusing all their efforts on locating the sub first before deploying any vessel capable of reaching as far below as 12,500 feet where the Titanic wreck is located.</p><p>Mauger, first district commander and leader of the search-and-rescue mission, said the US was coordinating with Canada on the operation.</p><p>The debris recovered from the US Coast Guard’s Titan submersible search site early Thursday included “a landing frame and a rear cover from the submersible.”</p><p>After search efforts to recover the stranded passengers proved futile, and <a href=#>bits of debris</a> from the submersible were found, it was decided that the sub imploded, which correlated with <a href=#>an anomaly picked up by the US Navy</a> in the same area.</p><p>The Coast Guard later reported that all 5 passengers <a href=#>were confirmed dead</a>, and rescue efforts were halted.</p><p><strong><a href=#>READ MORE</a></strong></p><p>Company officials were criticized for waiting eight hours after they lost communication with the Titan to alert authorities about the missing vessel on Sunday.</p><p>The entire journey to the shipwreck was only supposed to take 10 hours.</p><p>“We’re taking approaches that are used largely in the aerospace industry, is related to safety and some of the preponderance of checklists, uh, things we do for risk assessments and things like that, that are more aviation-related than, uh, ocean-related and we can train people to do that,” Rush had reportedly said.</p><p>“We can train someone to pilot the sub, we use a game controller, um, so anybody can drive the sub.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma2lfrLW6edKtppyjpKS7br7UrJ9mnJmZu7V5x6KpnmVlZXq6scCrZKiklGLEqbXTnmSgramoeqe70WaroqyRo7akedKumWasn6q%2FtHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alfonso-andre-net-worth-271703.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alfonso Andre Net Worth">&larr;
