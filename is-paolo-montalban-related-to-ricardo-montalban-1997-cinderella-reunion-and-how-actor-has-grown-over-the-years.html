Valera in The Great Raid, Kung Lao in Mortal Kombat: Conquest, and Sommelier in Just Wright.</p><p>Furthermore, Montalban will appear as Lee-Kwan Lee in the upcoming film Asian Persuasion, written and directed by Mike Ang and Jhett Tolentino, which is likely to premiere and release in early 2023.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paolo-montalban-is-unrelated-to-ricardo-montalban-despite-common-family-names></span>Paolo Montalban Is Unrelated To Ricardo Montalban Despite Common Family Names<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paolo Montalban and Ricardo Montalban might share the same last name, but that doesn’t make them have family ties or any connection that bind them.</p><p>Paolo and Ricardo are television personalities; however, the latter is no more. He expired at 88 due to complications from advancing age; he had congestive heart failure.</p><p>Furthermore, they belong to different countries; one is from the Philippines, and the other from Mexico. Thus, they are neither father-son nor distant relatives, so they have no ties with each other.</p><p>The Filipino-American actor was born to Paul and Vivian Montalban, and they immigrated to the United States when he was a year old. Likewise, the Mexican actor had four children Laura, Mark, Anita, and Victor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lgbtq-supporter-paolo-montalban-is-yet-to-get-married></span>LGBTQ Supporter Paolo Montalban Is Yet To Get Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paolo, who openly supports gay rights, is not married yet. The actor is single and has not committed to spending his forever with his lover yet; let alone he hasn’t revealed the identity of his lover.</p><p>The 1997 Cinderella actor hasn’t posted any pictures of him walking down the aisle or taking the wedding vows with his better half, nor has he made any romantic posts on his social networking sites.</p><p>Thus, we presume Montalban is unmarried, or he might have chosen not to expose his marital status to the public to enjoy his private life without gaining any unwanted attention from the media.</p><p>Or he might be a bachelor in search of a person who would accept his flaws, love him for what he is, and spend eternity with him. Hopefully, the performer will find his love and start a family soon so we can meet his mini version.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-untold-truth-on-his-past-relationships-and-dating-life></span>The Untold Truth On His Past Relationships and Dating Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Montalban is among many actors who have successfully kept their dating history confidential from the media; there is no intel relating to his past and present relationship available on the internet.</p><p>The actor has never revealed his internal matters and the identities of the people he has dated to protect their privacy, which is understandable as he is a public figure.</p><p>Although Paolo hasn’t revealed any details of his romantic life, it doesn’t mean he has always remained single. The 49-years old performer must have gone out with beautiful ladies but kept his love affair inside a closed door.</p><p>Moreover, he appears to end his relationship with his lovers on good terms as he has never made headlines for cheating or mistreating women. Or he might have a childhood sweetheart who became his lifelong partner but wants to keep it secret.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paolo-montalban-partner-is-he-gay></span>Paolo Montalban Partner: Is He Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paolo has never disclosed his identity as a gay, although he supports the LGBTQ+ community openly; he never came out as one or revealed his sexuality as homosexual.</p><p>However, as he hasn’t introduced his partner to his fans and well-wishers, speculation about him being an invert might have generated on the internet. But he might be in a live-in relationship with someone or has already tied the knot with his longtime lover.</p><p>The actor might have found his cinderella but has chosen not to expose his love affair to the public so they can have a healthy relationship with no media attention. Montalban is active on Instagram under the username&nbsp;@itspaolomontalban&nbsp;and has made 106 posts on his verified account. Furthermore, he has 29k followers as of the 25th of August 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYr2iu8uoZKannqmura7Ap2SrnZyWwaawjK2mZqqZmK6zsM5mpKimpJa5o63NZmhycWdisKq6w56pnqSclnqzsdSnoKimXZa7pXnHqK5mmZOpvLN5x5qqZp%2BipMSvec6vnKtlpJ2ybsXEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./olivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Olivia Wilde Net Worth 2022: How Rich Is This Person In 2022!">&larr;
